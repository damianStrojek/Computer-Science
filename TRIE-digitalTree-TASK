#TOWRITE
Implement a TRIE tree which contains translations of words. Word in original language and its translation will not be longer than 16 characters and 
will contain only lower case lettters.
The following commands should be supported:
+ s t
add a word s with the translation t
? s
query about a word s â€“ write a translation of s or - (minus sign) if it has not been added
* s
Write all translations of words such that s is a prefix of the word (including word s, if its contained in the tree). 
Translations should be written in alphabetical order of original words (see * d in example). Write - (minus sign) if no such word exists.
