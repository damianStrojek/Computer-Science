# Computer Science Algorithms

The algorithms that are here were made as part of projects at the Gdansk University of Technology by me. Creating new repositories for each of them didn't make sense, so I decided to collect them here. Some algorithms have problem content, others don't.

## TRIE Digital Tree

Implement a TRIE tree which contains translations of words. Word in original language and its translation will not be longer than 16 characters and will contain only lower case lettters.

The following commands should be supported:
- `+ s t` - add a word s with the translation t
- `? s` - query about a word s â€“ write a translation of s or - (minus sign) if it has not been added
`* s` - Write all translations of words such that s is a prefix of the word (including word s, if its contained in the tree). 

Translations should be written in alphabetical order of original words (see * d in example). Write - (minus sign) if no such word exists.

Example:

```
# Input
+ dog pies
+ cat kot
+ do robic
+ doggie piesek
+ doggies pieski
+ dolphin delfin
+ ant mrowka
+ zzz xxx
? dog
? cat
? do
? doggie
? dolphin
? ant
? zzz
? d
? dot
? dom
? dogg
? dol
? dolp
? dolph
? dolphi
? dolphine
* a
* d
* do
* dog
* dogg
* doggie
* doggies
* z
* b
* dot
* dolphen
* doggiess
```

```
# Output

## Hash Table

Write a program tracking the amount of transferred money. Commands are given in the following format:

- `+ [FROM] [TO] [AMOUNT]` - from pays to the specified amount
- `? [FROM] [TO]` - display the amount transferred by from to to's account

```bash
# Note: do not calculate a state of the account, track the sum of transfers:
+ A B 10
+ A B 10
+ B A 5
? A B
? B A
# should display:
20
5
```

Names from and to consist of maximally 16 lower case letters and underscores. The sum of transfers doesn't exceed int.
